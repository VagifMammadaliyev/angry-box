### Nothing really...
One of my little projects when I started to code. It is very nostalgic to me.

### What I did there?
Tried to implement some OOP using Javascript (not really)...

HTML, CSS + Bootstrap (...I guess), Javascript + jQuery (...may be), ... Actually I did not start coding journey from HTML/CSS/JS, I have learned basics of C++, then dived into the web.

##### Gameplay
Create your little box, choose controls and try to get as many food as you can! There is no end :)
